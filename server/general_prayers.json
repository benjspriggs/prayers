        "Intone, O My servant, the verses of Godthat have been received by thee,as intoned by them who have drawn nigh unto Him,that the sweetness of thy melody may kindle thine own soul,and attract the hearts of all men.Whoso reciteth, in the privacy of his chamber, the verses revealed by God, the scattering angels of the Almighty shall scatter abroad the fragrance of the words uttered by his mouth,and shall cause the heart of every righteous man to throb.Though he may, at first, remain unaware of its effect, yet the virtueof the grace vouchsafed unto him must needs sooner or later exerciseits influence upon his soul.Thus have the mysteries of the Revelation of God been decreedby virtue of the Will of Him Who is the Source of power and wisdom."
